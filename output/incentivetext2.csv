Tim Kaine offered amendments to the state budget to address the economic downturn that is negatively impacting the projected revenues needed to fund the core service functions of state government.To be successful, I will aggressively work to fund the operations at SEVTC until such time as these conditions can be met and to provide the funds to develop a community- based infrastructure that is equal to or exceeds the services currently available at SEVTC.To meet this goal, we must work cooperatively and collaboratively with the governor and his administration to provide the needed funds so that the local community service boards, the SEVTC professional staff, the families and the advocacy community can develop and implement a ""win-win"" strategy to protect the dignity and meet the needs of these vulnerable citizens.The Newport News Economic Development Authority, which has recently spent more than $1 million on City Center signage and surrounds, could surely, with the assistance of Williamsburg, Yorktown and Poquoson, donate a grant of half a million dollars to this vital musical organization.I am petitioning, as a taxpayer, for an outright grant for this vital symphony in our midst.And, as we will discuss tonight, I am moving forward on capital projects and business incentives designed to help create jobs.I have presented you a budget that tightens the belt of government, just as citizens and businesses are cutting their own expenses.THE BUDGET PROPOSAL   Educating our young people is one of the most fundamental things that government does-teaching our children and grandchildren to be responsible citizens, and preparing them to be competitive for the jobs of tomorrow.In fact, as we were cutting many state programs in the biennial budget passed last March, we increased funding for public education by approximately $1 billion for the biennium.My proposal is to reduce funding for administrative and support personnel in schools and central offices by applying a funding cap for these positions.For years we've applied a cap to determine the number of teachers and principals we fund-we should do the same for support staff.While it's never easy to make cuts to schools, my proposal focuses state funds to protect the students' experience in the classroom.I propose capping the enrollment to certain programs, freezing or reducing provider reimbursement rates, and delaying the expansion of certain services in order to cut over $400 million out of our Medicaid program.My proposed budget protects the advances we made in this biennial budget in funding our health care safety net.In the area of safety net expenditures, my budget includes funds for foreclosure prevention counseling to help families stay in their homes.And the budget also includes a $1 million grant to the Virginia Federation of Food Banks.As the economy has worsened, food banks across the Commonwealth have seen donations decline and their shelves depleted, even as more Virginians have found themselves in need of this vital assistance.Without a long-term commitment from the legislature to support transportation funding, and with a slump in existing revenue sources, dozens of road and bridge projects all across the Commonwealth have been taken out of the plan.First, we should expand an existing incentive for solar manufacturers to include new plants that make other alternative energy equipment and products.Second, we need to amend the current biofuels incentive grant to give a preference for those biofuels that do not compete with our food supply, and make it easier for small and start-up companies to earn the grant.For this reason, I propose to  give an income tax credit on solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, and wind-power electric generators installed in homes or businesses in Virginia.But, the disappearance of state and federal tax incentives caused the industry to shrink and research to decline.It would overturn partial birth abortion bans, eliminate parental notification, and force taxpayers to fund abortion.FOCA creates a fundamental right to abortion.FOCA would repeal the Hyde Amendment, allowing unlimited federal funding for abortion."

Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow announced that funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act would be allocated by the Department of the Interior for two new research vessels in the Great Lakes.Levin said this funding would create construction jobs, and that Michigan and the entire Great Lakes basin rely on the information collected by these research vessels.The capital for the vessels is expected to come as part of $30 million in ARRA funding set aside for deferred maintenance of facilities.The precise amount of funding that will be allocated to the Great Lakes vessels is not known at this time because the construction contract must be competitively bid.The four companies are A123 Systems, investing $600 million based on $125.2 million in Michigan state tax credits; Johnson Controls, investing $220 million based on $148.5 million in tax credits; LG Chem/Compact Power, investing $200 million based on $125 million in tax credits; and KD Advanced Battery Group–Dow Chemical, Kokam America, Townsend Ventures, investing $665 million based on $144.6 million in tax credits.State tax credits: $125 million.State tax credits: $125.2 million.State tax credits: $145.5 million.State tax credits: $144.6 million.Industry experts say the lithium ion battery plants ù spurred by more than $500 million in state tax credits and $27 billion more in available federal funding ù will allow now-expensive plug-in hybrid vehicle technology to become affordable by the time the market demands it.“Battery technology does appear to be a good bet, but the state, by giving tax incentives, is taking a business risk that they will be wrong on the pace of adoption on this specific type of battery technology,ö said Pat Anderson, principal of the Anderson Economic Group.About $1.7 billion total investment is planned by Johnson Controls-SAFT Advanced Power Solutions L.L.C., KD Advanced Battery Group L.L.C. and Korea-based LG Chem through its Troy-based subsidiary Compact Power Inc. to launch the new plants.In addition, the Michigan Economic Growth Authority has authorized more than $500 million in state tax credits.“It is appropriate for the government to be providing incentives because what it can do is accelerate the development of this sector ù the technology, the market ù because if it was left completely up to market forces, it would take longer,ö said Prabhakar Patil, CEO of Compact Power Inc.   Patil said he is not worried about the current low level of demand for hybrids.Compact Power, which is contracted to assemble battery packs for the Chevrolet Volt with cells made by its parent company, LG Chem, received about $125 million in government incentives for its planned $220 million investment.Other companies are chasing additional incentives to speed their battery development.David Vieau, CEO of A123 Systems Inc., said the company has applied for $1.84 billion under the Department of Energy’s $25 billion Advanced Vehicle Technology Loan program and plans to apply for additional funding under the $2 billion set aside for advanced battery manufacturing in the stimulus bill.That’s on top of the $125.2 million MEGA credit granted for A123’s $600 million Livonia plant.The stimulus bill’s consumer tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying plug-in hybrid vehicles is a significant driver needed to advance lithium ion cars in the market, Vieau said.He noted A123 was part of a team that worked with government officials to promote that incentive.Co pyrig ht 20 0 9 Crain Co mmunicatio ns Inc                  Cit at ion (ag lc St yle )              RYAN BEENE, 'Incentives lead the charge - Hybrid-car battery plants on the way, positive or              negative', Crain's Detroit Business (online), 20 Apr 2009, 25 (16) 0001              ‹http://haproxy.newsbank.com:11021:11021/apps/news/document-view?

Timothy M. Kaine's administration hasn't officially weighed in on the Northrop incentives, but he has been aggressive about economic development during the economic crunch.Hamilton, a supporter of the Rolls-Royce deal, said the economic benefits generated by the Northrop incentives would far outweigh the state investment.In that deal, lawmakers bundled nearly $57 million in incentive grants to be doled out over 16 years.The incentive grant program was put in place in Virginia more than a decade ago as a way for the state to compete for domestic and foreign business investment.By stretching out the incentives over years and linking the bonuses to performance, lawmakers have eased some of the political and financial heartburn that goes with handing out state money to thriving private industries.Goya was founded by Spanish immigrants to the United States and is based in Secaucus, N.J.   ***************   The economy of the Richmond area is so closely linked to the global market that even baking bread can be an international affair.And, as we will discuss tonight, I am moving forward on capital projects and business incentives designed to help create jobs.I have presented you a budget that tightens the belt of government, just as citizens and businesses are cutting their own expenses.THE BUDGET PROPOSAL   Educating our young people is one of the most fundamental things that government does-teaching our children and grandchildren to be responsible citizens, and preparing them to be competitive for the jobs of tomorrow.In fact, as we were cutting many state programs in the biennial budget passed last March, we increased funding for public education by approximately $1 billion for the biennium.My proposal is to reduce funding for administrative and support personnel in schools and central offices by applying a funding cap for these positions.For years we've applied a cap to determine the number of teachers and principals we fund-we should do the same for support staff.While it's never easy to make cuts to schools, my proposal focuses state funds to protect the students' experience in the classroom.I propose capping the enrollment to certain programs, freezing or reducing provider reimbursement rates, and delaying the expansion of certain services in order to cut over $400 million out of our Medicaid program.My proposed budget protects the advances we made in this biennial budget in funding our health care safety net.In the area of safety net expenditures, my budget includes funds for foreclosure prevention counseling to help families stay in their homes.And the budget also includes a $1 million grant to the Virginia Federation of Food Banks.As the economy has worsened, food banks across the Commonwealth have seen donations decline and their shelves depleted, even as more Virginians have found themselves in need of this vital assistance.Without a long-term commitment from the legislature to support transportation funding, and with a slump in existing revenue sources, dozens of road and bridge projects all across the Commonwealth have been taken out of the plan.First, we should expand an existing incentive for solar manufacturers to include new plants that make other alternative energy equipment and products.Second, we need to amend the current biofuels incentive grant to give a preference for those biofuels that do not compete with our food supply, and make it easier for small and start-up companies to earn the grant.For this reason, I propose to  give an income tax credit on solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, and wind-power electric generators installed in homes or businesses in Virginia.But, the disappearance of state and federal tax incentives caused the industry to shrink and research to decline."

Union, called the Hutch Card.Dino Dig, and its funding, is something the community and credit union President Garth Strand can take considerable pride in.However, virtually all discussion about the financial incentives government is willing to offer is required to take place in an open meeting, according to a 1988 Kansas attorney general opinion.Attorney general opinion   When The News asked the Kansas Attorney General's Office specifically about the discussion of financial incentives, Assistant Attorney General Michael Smith pointed to Attorney General Opinion No. 88-148, issued in October 1988 by then-Attorney General Robert Stephan.That opinion, involving the Geary County Economic Development Commission, stated that a board could discuss in executive session the use of public money to acquire land for business sites but that the exception did not extend to all discussions about financial incentives.But Patterson argues that to ""just say blanket, that you can't discuss financial incentives, I think that's reading that too broadly.""But the public board would not have been able to venture onto the topic of financial incentives, in the view of Merriam and according to the 1988 attorney general opinion.The lesson learned from that incident, Patterson said, is that the governing board must have a public discussion about incentives.But in Merriam's view, conducting the public discussion about government financial incentives after the contract is drafted and on the table represents ""a complete misunderstanding of executive session.""Financial incentives are not intended to be revealed in the first public discussion following secret negotiations, he said.The council's June 16 agenda originally included an item to approve the development agreement, which will outline the city's financial incentive offerings to the wind energy company.A financial incentive package, including $2 million in grants from local governments as well as the 100- acre business park site, was offered to the company.The incentive package has not yet been approved by local governments, although members of the Hutchinson and South Hutchinson city councils and the Reno County Commission are aware of the package and have discussed it in closed sessions.The Obama administration included in its stimulus package $56 billion in grants and tax breaks for clean energy projects over the next 10 years, and $15 billion annually in the budget.The federal government encouraged the growth of ethanol with significant subsidies and requirements.A tax credit to refiners amounts to 51 cents per gallon of ethanol.Last year's rapid growth was a reaction to high natural gas prices, free credit markets and continued government subsidies, he said.The stimulus bill approved in February converted the wind energy tax credit that Congress previously had to re-approve every year to a grant program that will run for three years.That allows investors to feel more secure and counteracts the drying up of the market for tax credits, he said.This unexpected but good news was made possible by a significant amount of city debt retirement in 2009, resulting in a projected six-mill reduction in the property tax levy feeding the bond and interest fund for 2010.The mill reduction in the bond and interest fund is balanced out by a needed   increase to the property tax levy in the general fund.Currently, city staff is suggesting a four-mill increase in the general fund, which would leave the public looking at a two-mill decrease to the city property tax levy overall.If both those projects move forward, it will require a three-mill increase to the property tax levy feeding the bond and interest fund in 2011, when payments on those bond issues will begin, said Finance Director Carl Myers.Seeking balance   Even with a four-mill increase to the general fund, operating expenses will outpace revenues by $1.65  million in 2010.In the past, the city has covered these overages with one-time transfers from other funds, such as the workers' compensation fund, the risk management fund and the refuse fund.Those funds' balances, however, will no longer be healthy enough to support the general fund, and the council has made a goal of creating a truly balanced budget - in which the city spends no more than it brings in - within three years.The city's goal then would be to lower the 2011 budget deficit to one-third of the 2008 level and have a truly balanced budget - without the use of any fund transfers - in 2012.The rest of the $1.65 million overage can be covered through one-time cuts or minimal transfers from other funds.For example, the $1.65 million overage was projected based on several assumptions - including that the city would increase it's general fund payment to the worker's compensation fund by $300,000 over last year's payment, and that it would budget for a $3 million general fund reserve - up by about $1.4 million from what was budgeted for

"Siemens","KS","For the past several years, residents, under the Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit, could apply for a tax credit for up to 30 percent of the cost of buying and installing renewable energy systems, including solar water heaters, photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, fuel cells or geothermal heat pumps.There is a separate federal grant and loan program for commercial or agricultural industries that install renewable energy systems.The Rural Energy for America Program offers a grant of up to 25 percent of the system cost and a guaranteed loan, which, when combined with the grant, can cover up to 75 percent of the project cost, up to $25 million.Net metering   Other new funding legislation is a net metering law adopted by Kansas lawmakers as part of the compromise bill to open the way for Sunflower Electric to build a new coal plant at Holcomb.Not a real incentive for private development, is it?Without the city investing $425,000 in 1998 to buy land and develop the Salt City Business Park south of Avenue G and west of Yoder Road, coupled with creating an economic opportunity fund with sales tax dollars three years earlier, Siemens probably would not have chosen Hutchinson.Not a real incentive for private development, is it?Another new law creates incentives for wind-power manufacturing plants to locate in Kansas and has already resulted in a German company, Siemens, announcing plans to manufacture turbines in Hutchinson, with the possible addition of 400 jobs to the economy.Holmes voted against an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, saying raising eligibility limits to 250 percent of poverty level would subsidize families making up to $80,000 a year.Local residents interested in developing new or existing businesses, and existing businesses interested in discussing their financing and other assistance needs, can meet with KSBDC counselors during this time.KSBDC assistance is confidential and provided without charge.Chanute artists invited to enter competition   The Topeka Art Guild invites Chanute artists to participate in their second annual ""Kansans Paint Kansas"" fundraising competition.The council's agenda originally included a discussion-only study session item regarding a development agreement with Siemens, which would include details on what incentives the city plans to offer, but that item was removed late last week.Cit at ion (ag lc St yle )               The News staff, 'Siemens discussion off council's agenda', Hutchinson News, The (online), 19               May 2009 ‹http://haproxy.newsbank.com:11021:11021/apps/news/document-view?               p=WORLDNEWS&docref=news/1284A95E5F6093D8›  About incentives May 18, 2009 | Hutchinson News, The (KS) Author: John D.
