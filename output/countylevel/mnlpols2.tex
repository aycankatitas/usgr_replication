\multicolumn{3}{p{\linewidth}}{\footnotesize Multinomial logit coefficients estimated via maximum likelihood. The outcome is a categorical variable that indicates  never, old and new county status. The baseline category is never counties. An election is competitive if the difference in two-party vote share is less than 10 percentage points. Eligibility to run is determined by whether a governor ran for the subsequent election. All models include state fixed effects. Robust standard errors are in parentheses and clustered by state. * p$<$0.10, ** p$<$0.05, *** p$<$0.010}\\
